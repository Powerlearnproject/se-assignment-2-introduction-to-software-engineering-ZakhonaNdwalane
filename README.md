Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

it is a systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and
tools to the development  and mantainance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of sotfware products.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. whereas traditional refers to the conventional approach of writing code to create specific instructions for a computer to follow. It involves explicitly defining every step and condition, leaving no room for the system to learn or adapt independently. 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Software engineering life cyle consists of different phases, including; 
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface. 
Implementation: Writing tcode and building the software according to the design specifications. 
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. 
Deployment: Realesing the software to users or customers 
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment. 

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall Model: A linear, Sequential approach to the software development lifecycle  that is popular in software engineering and product development. 
Agile Model: It is an iterative and incremental software development approach focussed on flexibility collaboration, and responding to change. 

 Agile models are suitable for projects requiring flexibility and constant requirements changes, such as software development, where customer feedback and engagement are critical. Scenario practices when client requirements keep changing, the project has a longer time framework. 

 Waterfall models are ideal for projects with well-defined stages and straightforward, linear requirements. Scenario practices can be when the client requirements are not frequently changing, the application is not big or complicated, requirements are specified and clear, the project itself is short or has a specific time framework. 

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

The requirement development process is a critical part of software development. It ensures that all stakeholders understand the user's needs and expectations and that these are translated into a functional and technical specification that guides the development team. (LinkedIn, 2023).
Requirement engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating and managing the needs and expectations of the stakeholders for a software system. 
The requirements engineering process is four-step process which includes:
*Feasibility study
*Requirements elicitation and analysis
*Software requirement specification 
*Software requirement validation
*Software requirement management

The requirement engineering is critical to the success of a project as it tells everyone involved with the project what needsto be done. 

Software Design Principles:

Are concerned with providing means to handle the complexity of the design processs effectively. Problem partitioning; Abstraction; Modularity, Top down & Bottom up strategy. 

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity specifies  to th division of software into separate modules which are differently named and addressed and are integrated later on in to obtain the completely functional software (Javapoint.com, accessed 2024)

A modular system is easier to understand because the functionality is split among distinct modules. its also easier to maintain beacause changes to one module generally won't affect the others. well-designed modules are reusable meaning the same code can be used in different parts of the application or even different applications. 

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Software testing levels descriptions: 
Unit testing: type of testing that uses tests for a single component or a single unit in software testing and this kind of testing is performed by the developer.
Integration testing: means combining different softwares modules and phases and testing as a group to ensure that the integrated system is ready or not, and there are main ways to test how different components of the system function at their interface. 
System testing: is the final test to identify that the system meets the specifications and criteria and it evaluates both function and non-function needs to the testing.
Acceptance testing: aims to evaluate whether the the system compiles with the end-user requirements for the development. 
Software testing is crucial aspect of quality assurance, ensuring that the software functions meet the expected requirements specifications.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. 
version control systems are crucial to developers as they keep track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn baack the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimising the disruption to all team members. 
examples of version control systems
Github: supplies a centralised platform for hosting repositories, managing collaborative work, and providing issue tracking, project managemet tools, and pull requests. 
GitLab: allows repository hosting, collaboration tools, issue tracking and continuous integration
Snowtrack: Allows for easy collaboration with others, pull & push versions and share progress without difficult conflicts and reconciles. 
Simul: any user can access the latest word document, can make changes in both word and word online.



Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Software project managers role are in planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing out projects. They are accountable for the entire project scope, the project team and resources, the project budget, and the success or failure of the project. 

Responsibilities include:
project scheduling, staffing, estimation, risk management, miscellaneous planning
Challenges include: 
poor communication, time constraints, changing technologies, motivating team members, managing risks, high competition etc. 


Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs (geekforgeeks.org, accessed 2024). 

Different types of maintenance activities are corrective maintenance, patching, adaptive maintenance, perfective maintenance, preventive maintenance.

Maintenance software functionality, make upgrades to the coding, and ensure any repairs needed to the software are completed. The customer is responsible for maintaining the software by upgrading it when advised.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues: algorithmic bias, unethical data bias, weak security, wrong priorities.
to ensure they adhere to the ethical standards they need to be proactive, be honest,  be accountable, be a responsible citizen.
